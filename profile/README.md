## What is SyncToSheet?

SyncToSheet lets recruiters, researchers, and sales teams get **LinkedIn data into Google Sheets** without manual exports or complex APIs. You browse LinkedIn as usual; when you're on a profile or company page, click **Sync** in the extension and the data is appended to your chosen spreadsheet.

- **LinkedIn to Google Sheets** – Sync visible profile fields (name, headline, location, company, about, profile URL, and more) or company page data into a sheet.
- **Chrome extension** – Works on linkedin.com. No background scraping; data is taken from the page you're viewing.
- **Your sheet, your columns** – Map each field to the column you want. One automation per sheet tab.
- **No code** – Connect Google (OAuth), create automations in the dashboard, install the extension. No scripts or API keys to manage.
